 * There are n services numbered from 1 to n in a system, and there are m requests to be processed. The service in which the ith request is cached is denoted by cache[i], for all 1 <= i <= m. For any request, If the request is processed from its cached service, it takes 1 unit of time. Otherwise, it takes 2 units of time.

Different services can process different requests simultaneously, but one service can only process one request at a time. Find the minimum time to process all the requests by allocating each request to a service.

Example
It is given that n = 3, m = 5, and cache = [1, 1, 3, 1, 1].
If the 1st, 2nd, and 4th requests are assigned to the 1st service, it will take 1 unit of time each, or 3 units of time to process them in total.
Assign the 3rd request to the 2nd service and the 5th request to the 3rd service. It takes 1 and 2 units of time to complete them, respectively. Therefore, all requests are processed in 3 units of time.

Function Description
Complete the function getMinTime in the editor below.

getMinTime has the following parameters:
	int n: the number of services in the system
	int cache[m]: the service in which the request is cached (of length m)

Returns
int: the minimum time required to process all requests

Constraints
1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5
1 <= cache[i] <= n

Sample Case 0
Input
n = 4  
cache = [1, 2, 3, 4]
Output
1

Explanation
Each request is cached in a different service. Process all of them at once, which takes 1 unit of time.
