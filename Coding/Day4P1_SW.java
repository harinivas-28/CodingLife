/*
In a film festival, there is a lineup of movies, each with a rating. The festival
organizer wants to find the maximum total rating of 'k' sequence of movies while
following these rules:
    1. The sequence must be exactly k movies long.
    2. Each movie in the sequence must have a distinct rating.
    3. None of the movies in the sequence should have a restricted rating, as
       these are reserved for special screenings.

Given an array movieRatings representing the sequence of movie ratings, an integer k
representing the length of the sequence, and a set restrictedRatings (of size m) of
special ratings, find the maximum total rating of any valid sequence.
If no valid sequence exists, return -1.

Input Format:
-------------
Line-1: 3 space separated integers, n, k, m
Line-2: n space separated integers, movieRatings[].
Line-3: m space separated integers, restrictedRatings[].

Output Format:
-------------
An integer, the maximum total rating of any valid sequence


Sample Input-1:
---------------
7 3 2
1 5 4 2 9 9 9
2 9

Sample Output-1:
----------------
10

Explanation:
------------
The sequences of movie ratings with length 3 are:
- [1, 5, 4] which meets the requirements and has a total rating of 10.
- [5, 4, 2] which does not meet the requirements because 2 is in the
restricted set.
- [4, 2, 9] which does not meet the requirements because 2 and 9 are in
the restricted set.
- [2, 9, 9] which does not meet the requirements because 2 and 9 are in
the restricted set and 9 is repeated.
- [9, 9, 9] which does not meet the requirements because 9 is in
the restricted set and repeated.

We return 10 because it is the maximum total rating of all the sequences
that meet the conditions.


Sample Input-2:
---------------
3 3 1
4 4 4
4

Sample Output-2:
----------------
-1

Explanation: The sequences of movie ratings with length 3 are:
[4, 4, 4] which does not meet the requirements because 4 is repeated and in the
restricted set.
We return -1 because no sequences meet the conditions.

Constraints:
------------
0 <= m <= n <=1000
k <= n
0 ≤ restrictedRatings.length ≤ 1000
