Luke likes to construct and play with arrays. His dad gave him an array M of
length N and assigned him the following tasks to be done in order:
 - create continuous groups of size i from the array M (where i goes from 1 to N).
 - For each group of size i, find the minimum value.
 - Among all the minimums from that step, select the maximum.
 - Add this selected value as the i-th element of a new array P.
 - Repeat until i = N.

Note: Use 1-based indexing for array P in logic.

Input Format:
-------------
input1: Integer N â€“ length of array M
input2: Integer array M of length N

Output Format:
--------------
Return the array P as output.

Sample Input:
-------------

Sample Output:
--------------
3 2 1


Sample Input:
