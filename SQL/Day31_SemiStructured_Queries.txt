Sample Output::

NAME	INTEREST
Alice	"books"
Alice	"music"
Bob	"gaming"
Bob	"travel"

-->
select name, flat.value as interests from customer_profiles,
lateral flatten(input=>profile:interests) as flat;

<!--

> Using the `profile:interests` array, count how many customers have each

Sample Output::

INTEREST	TOTAL_CUSTOMERS
books        	1
music       	1
gaming      	1
travel      	1


-->
select interest, count(interest) as total_customers from
